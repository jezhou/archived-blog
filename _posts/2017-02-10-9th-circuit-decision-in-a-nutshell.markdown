Really interesting read. Highly recommend anyone who's interested in the 9th Circuit opinion to read their reasoning for not reinstating Trump's immigration order.

The States v. Trump in a nutshell

1. Explains the background of the law, from when Trump signed it to when federal courts issued a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) against the law. From what I understand, the TRO is basically what is stopping the travel ban from being reinstated. Usually, TROs are only for 2 weeks, but the intention of this TRO is to last longer than that.

2. The States (who do not want the law to be reenacted) complain that the Executive Branch has no right to file an appeal against the TRO, since they are not usually appealable. However, the 9th circuit says because the TRO is going to last more than 14 days and because of the extraordinary circumstances of this case, the 9th circuit has jurisdiction and will continue to review the appeal.

3. Now the Executive Branch complains, because they say the States have no grounds for a case against the ban. However, the 9th circuit says that the States have provided enough evidence of how the ban affects them, mainly their universities and how it affects students and faculty. Basically, universities put a lot of investment into recruiting smart students from abroad, and current and any future investments will be lost if a TRO is not issued. This is way more than enough to give The States the benefit of the doubt.

4. The Executive Branch also complains the 9th Circuit has no power to review what they think is undisputed authority from the President. The 9th Circuit basically laughs at this, saying that this line of thinking "runs contrary to the fundamental structure of our constitutional democracy."

5. Basically the things they were looking for in the decision, which the 9th circuit determines the Government didn't do a good job providing evidence that the travel ban was absolutely necessary

6. 9th Circuit says due process applies to EVERYONE in the United States, not just citizens. Cites the fifth amendment and another case. Taking away the ability to travel  without any notice beforehand and no trial is depriving people of "life, liberty, or property without due process of law."

7. Cites religious discrimination. Although it's not stated in the law, The States provide enough evidence that the ban is intended to disfavor Muslims, citing things like statements Trump made during his campaign. 9th circuit finds this seriously troubling.

8. The Executive Branch basically has no evidence of a terrorist from any of these countries doing irreparable harm to the United States, nor do they have any reason to believe there is an impending attack. Instead, the Executive Branch is saying to just trust them. The 9th Circuit disagrees with this because of all of the previous reasons (LOL)

9. Conclusion: Nope, ain't gonna happen
