I recently updated my blog to the [**Ghost**]() platform! Before, I was using a combination of [**Jekyll**]() and Github pages, and while it was all free, it's a hassle to write blog posts about whatever I'm thinking at the moment. It's partly because there's just so much *technical shit* I gotta work with to upload ONE post: 

1. First, I gotta write the post. That's fine and easy to do.
2. But let's say I have some pictures I want to put alongside with what I'm writing. Because Jekyll uses Markdown, I literally have to first get the image I want, drag it to my static assets, figure out the relative path to the image, and finally tack in onto my blog post! And this process, if you have a lot of images, can be super annoying...
3. When I'm finally ready to upload a post, you gotta do the whole `git` shebang too, which after awhile, can be tiring (even though it technically increases the # of commits I contribute to my Github account, hehe).

Anyway, all of that made me feel like this every time I wanted to publish something:

**Ghost**, on the other hand, makes writing things a true blessing and distraction free. The best way I can describe it is that it's like **Medium**, except that you are in control of way, way more things. It's like if Medium let you into the cockpit of the software, rather than just giving you an economy seat.

Also, Ghost **uses Markdown**. I love it. I don't have to fool around with any "text palettes" anymore. If I can just focus on typing, then the experience is much more blissful. Also, you start to notice how much time you save without consistently moving your hand to the goddamn mouse.


Best thing about Ghost is that it's open source too! I just have to host this on a Digitalocean Droplet for around $5 a month. Not bad!

Anyway, lots to look forward to.
