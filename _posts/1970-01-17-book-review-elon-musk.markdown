*In the spirit of being a more avid reader, I'm going to start doing book reviews of everything I happen to finish. I usually post my reviews to GoodReads but they have a cool feature that allows you to take your review's text and autoformat it for a blog. I'm probably going to try to cross post as much as possible* ðŸ˜„

My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1891441572">5 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
I read this book with the intention to learn more about the man behind the machines that have made Tesla and SpaceX household names among the engineering community. I wasn't disappointed by Vance's thorough and exhaustive report on Musk, who I can't help but put higher on a pedestal now looking at everything he's gone through.<br /><br />At the same time though, reading about his personality and character is what surprises me most. His ambition and dream to ensure humanity's survival ironically seems to have affected his own humanity, in ways that only we, as third parties, can clearly see. Based on Vance's assessment, he is ludicrously optimistic and irrational, which is good because only when people are such things do they create such mesmerizing products like the Model S or the Falcon Heavy rockets. However, Musk is also at the same time callous and a workaholic among workaholics, with an extreme and godlike dedication to his craft. The way Vance blends together all of these little aspects of Musk and interweaves it with his life â€“ from Zip2 to Paypal to SpaceX to Tesla â€“ ultimately makes a biography unlike any other.<br /><br />Vance's insistence to create an unbiased perspective of Musk is what makes this book a worthwhile read. I suspect I'll read it again sometime in my life (because it really was that good), and I'll have to suggest it to people who are crazy about Tesla, SpaceX, Elon Musk, or just changing the future in general. <br /><br />Peter Thiel's general sentiment that "we wanted flying cars, but we got 140 characters" was true up until the the emergence of Elon Musk. Now, it'll be up to him and all the engineers and entrepreneurs he's inspired (like me) to pave the way for the future.
