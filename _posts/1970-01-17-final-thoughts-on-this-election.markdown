I have some quick and final thoughts about this election cycle that I wanted to write down.

### On Trump supporters

I've been seeing a lot of posts about how all Trump supporters are racist or deplorable, but I think that's dramatically oversimplifying it. You wouldn't have five states flip from voting a black man into office (twice) to voting Trump unless there were [other reasons](http://www.cracked.com/blog/6-reasons-trumps-rise-that-no-one-talks-about/).

Trickle down didn't work for a lot of people struggling in rural areas, and the Democrats have largely ignored the needs of these areas as well. The hope and change that Obama preached didn't work for them. There is a reason why the non-city counties are red while the densely populated ones are blue. It's like looking at blue islands in a sea of red.

I think us west coast folk do not put enough effort into thinking about the plights that affect the rest of the states. California is, after all, one state of fifty, and we're one of the most liberal. Of course most of us would have an adverse reaction to a Trump presidency, and that's because we're not really trying to understand why these people are frustrated. We're too busy regurgitating the same liberal and progressive ideas on Twitter and Facebook, to people we know already share our values and probably live in densely populated places as well.

This country was split 50-50. There are an equal amount of people celebrating Trump as there are people mourning for America. I think really reflecting on this point will open some eyes. Yes it's true, some might be celebrating because maybe to them, it validates that crude and racist behavior is okay. But maybe there are some Trump supporters that are celebrating because they think it means the end of hard times. They tried Bush and Obama for sixteen years, and it didn't work for them. So instead, voting for the renegade was the only way to shake things up and tell Washington that, hey, you need to start paying attention to us. 

I think understanding this is a key point in trying to compromise the next four years. It's incredibly unfortunate that most people, me included, are trying to have this discussion after the election rather than before going to the booths. Maybe it would've encouraged more people to go out and vote.

### On the Donald

Being more liberal than I am conservative, I don't like the guy. ~~He talks too much and people who talk too much advertise their own ignorance.~~ (A friend just showed me [this](http://blog.dilbert.com/post/150919416661/why-i-switched-my-endorsement-from-clinton-to). If you go down a bit, apparently Trump is a master of persuasion, which is why he runs his mouth. I still don't like how much he talks.)

But regardless of whether we like him or not, he won. And, through gritted teeth, we have to concede and admit that he is going to be our next president. He might not be as racist as we all think he is; like a little boy who might not get candy at the supermarket, he might have been causing a scene 90 percent of the time he was on camera just to get more views and more "free advertising" by the media. If this were the truth, does it excuse anything he's said or done? Absolutely not, and I have a feeling we will continue to crucify him for this until the end of his presidency, and maybe that's punishment enough. 

But as for his actual actions, we can't be too quick to judge him. The truth is we don't really know what he's actually going to do because he hasn't done anything yet. Most presidents have a really hard time following through with all of their campaign promises (see Obama), so I don't think he's actually going to build a wall or prevent Muslims from entering the country. I think even a good number of Republican congressmen think that's bullshit.

Honestly, having a Republican controlled congress won't be that bad because it's not like Republicans like him either. I would more worry about the HoR and Senate's own agenda, which is to undo Obama's accomplishments, than worry about the Donald building a wall (who the fuck is going to pay for it? It's literally just populist BS).

### On media bias

This is kind of one of the things you don't realize until it's all over. I've been reading the New York Times for months and I can admit that I bought into their predictions that there was going to be a 90 percent chance of a Clinton presidency.

And now, in retrospect, I could see how completely biased the Times is when it came to this election. Their editorials leaked into their supposedly top quality articles that followed top quality journalistic standards. And not just the Times, but cable news networks and other huge media bastions tried to turn the tide, and I think that had a counter-effect of instilling too much overconfidence in all of us.

I mean, why go knock on doors for Clinton if the media is telling me that there's a 99 percent chance of a Clinton presidency anyway? In the meantime, Trump and his supporters never gave up. He pushed them to the polls with his fiery rhetoric, and it worked a hell of a lot better than the media telling us that there was nothing to worry about.

My dad said most of us were brainwashed by the media, and it's hard to admit, but he was right. The media largely ignored the middle part of America and ignored the fact that the supposedly "impossible" could happen. It turns out, when you treat someone like a joke, it will most likely just make them stronger.

I'm not going to rely on the Times too much anymore as my only news source for current events. In order to have a well-balanced view of the world, it requires talking to different people and having a well-balanced mix of sources for information. 

You can be sure that I will be acutely aware of media bias in future elections.

### On the electoral college

Every election season people complain about this supposedly rigged and archaic system, and to them I just say that if the opposite happened, as in if Trump won the popular vote but not the electoral one, no one supporting Clinton would be complaining. In fact, we'd probably be praising the system and saying, "Thank god for the electoral college! That was a close call."

Alas we're on the underside of that coin flip, which sucks ass. But if you truly didn't want this system, I think you would complain even if Clinton won, not just whenever it's convenient for you.

### On #Calexit

I really don't think the solution is to secede from the Union. As a Californian, I am part of a state that treasures progressive values, and to remove that from the melting pot that is the United States would be removing a huge sea of voices and opportunity for future people who need us to succeed. We're 55 electoral votes, which is basically 20% of what's needed to become president. How is the US going to get another progressive president if we decide to bail because we lost? Remember, we're a fortress of blue in a sea of red, and like a fortress we should stay strong and defend what we believe in.

Also, with Brexit happening and Trump promising to cut ties with a lot of countries, I really don't think further splitting the world collective is such a good idea. Like Clinton said, we're always going to be stronger together.

### Final thoughts

Now this all being said, I know how much this sucks and I know what the implications of a Trump presidency are. This means that most of Obama's reform over the past 8 years will be scrapped and be replaced with new ones that might make most liberal Americans uncomfortable. This might make the environment more dangerous and less-friendly to my POC or LGBT friends, and the prospect of that is terrifying. Even being an Asian-American, the so called "model minority", makes me nervous because I am still a minority. I'm not 100 percent sure what the future holds for me and my friends.

But even if I'm a little nervous now, I will always be proud to be an American. I was a Boy Scout for 11 years and I was taught to love this country with all of the freedom and flaws that come with it. Yes, I'm from one of the most liberal states in the country, but I'm an American first before anything else, and I'm not going to give up on the country that gracefully accepted my parents, who worked so hard to make sure my life here was better than where they grew up.

I am obviously upset that Trump won. But that's the beauty of this election: it was at its core a democratic process. And although Republicans now control all three branches of government, it will never stay like that forever. Our democracy always flip flops, and it just so happens that for the next four years, it's going to be a little Red.

And that's ok. We gon' be alright.
