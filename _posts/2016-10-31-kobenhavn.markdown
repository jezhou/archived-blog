I had the pleasure of visiting my friend in Copenhagen last week. It was quite a weekend: lots of sites to see and people to meet!

One of the things I love most about Copenhagen was the biking culture of the city. Each bike has this funny little lock that allows you to immobilize it wherever you want, which basically means that the only way someone can steal it is by literally picking up your bike off the ground and running away with it.

Which, in the US, someone would still do. But the people in Copenhagen don't like fucking with other people's bikes, because of the fact that **so** many people bike and because I think people take biking pretty seriously there.

Lucy (my friend) lent me one of her friend's bikes. Here's a picture of me tryna pose:

One of my favorite places here was the Copenhagen Street Food place. For those of you who don't know, I love eating duck, so I was thrilled that they had a delicious food place called "Duck It". I had a duck burger and something called duck fries. I couldn't finish all of it because it was so filling!

Speaking of food, I also tried the Sm√∏rrebr√∏d! This was a weird traditional dish and I didn't really like it as much. But hey, you can't crucify me for not having it now.

## Halloweekend and Communal Living

We went clubbing the first day in Copenhagen (which was pretty fun and crazy), and went to a proper halloween party our second day there. 

The funny thing about Halloween here is that Danes don't really celebrate Halloween, but if they do, they go scary. I wish I took more pictures of this, but there are some scary costumes out there. Not really any cutesy things (maybe a handful, but it's not more commonplace like it is in the states). 

Nick (my other friend) and I got to stay in the dorms while most of the students were prepping for the parties. What I like about the dorms compared to Edinburgh and UCSD is that they're very communal. There's an open floor space that allows access to every room on the floor. Also, each room seems *massive*, and there's things like "dinner nights" that force students to gather and work together, and make friends with each other. 

I think unequivocally one of the hardest things about college is making friends with people. It's easy to do when you're in high school because everyone more or less shares the same values as you do, but in the real world you have to jump feet first into gatherings in which you may potentially not know anyone. Even for people who are more naturally introverted like me, it can be pretty scary sometimes.

Also, the dorms are really fucking clean compared to where I'm living in the UK. I'm probably not paying as much, as Denmark in general costs an arm and a leg to live there, but *damn* it's pretty nice for a dorm.

## Parties

I'm not really sure what I was expecting with this one, but parties are the same here (more or less). The one we went to was fun because the pre-drinking event they had was like an international beer pong tournament. We ended up pitting the United States against the UK, and like the revolutionary war, we won. Again.

Remember, remember, the 30th of October! We had a dude literally snipe the last cup (and that's when we started singing the national anthem). It was quite a lot of fun üèì

We ended up going to another location later. The music was kind of soft? I think the clubbing from the earlier night was a lot better, but that may just be me. I still got to meet a lot of people, which is all you can really ask for sometimes.

We got burgers from this place called Max's afterwards with Lucy and her Canadian friend. This will probably be the closest thing I will ever get to In-N-Out while I'm abroad üòÇ

## Touristy Stuff

As always, we visited some weird touristy places, like the Danish Design museum (really should be renamed the Chair museum):

The lego store (Legos originated in Denmark!):

The castle (ignore my hair, it looks weird here):

and last but not least, Christiania. Holy shit, this place is so different from the rest of Copenhagen. It started as a "free town" in which basically everything goes? Essentially, there's a lot of Marijuana and stuff that's dealt under the table, which tourists can engage in if they're feeling adventurous. Christiania was kind of like if Amsterdam started looking like a hippy commune.

You're not really allowed to take too many pictures there, but I snapped a few before some people noticed. Dude, they YELL at you if they catch you taking photos. They even spray graffiti art of cameras being crossed out to emphasize how much they do not like pictures in this free town.

There was a nice lake to sit by in Christiania. It was nice to catch up with Lucy there. I'm not gonna lie, she was a really good host.

We ate these traditional Danish sandwiches (which were really burgers) and they were REALLY good! This was the final thing I had before I said my goodbyes to Lucy.

All in all, it was a really good trip. I think I got to experience Danish culture in its entirety without being too much of a tourist. I'm going to definitely recommend people who want to study abroad to check this place out (especially if they can afford it).
