title: This is democracy

Hillary Clinton lost. She was right there. She was almost the first female President of the United States. We were at the cusp of history.

And then, defying all odds, the rabid underdog surged ahead.

Most major news outlets predicted Clinton would sweep, given how insane Donald Trump was. As the night carried on, the opposite turned out to be true.

This was, by all means, a historically stunning upset. 

As Americans, we pride ourselves on our rights, freedoms, and democracy, which we cherish above all else. Today, unfortunately, democracy has shown its darker side. It gave the establishment the finger and said, "We're angry with how you do things, and we're sick of the lying. So we're going to try something new. Even if it means electing Donald Trump as the most powerful man in the world."

There's a lot of anger everywhere right now, partly because this is so hard to understand. After all the hope and change from 2008 and electing our first minority president, how could we make a dramatic U-Turn and do the complete opposite this presidential election?

You could point your fingers at Clinton. True, she was by all means a perfect politician, but that's part of what the problem was. People this election cycle didn't want a perfect politician. Perfect politicians were the people who had hidden email servers, who had foundations that accepted money from foreign countries, who just do things that don't seem to earn the trust of the public. 

The people, apparently, wanted an outsider, someone who was anti-establishment and had no strings (or so it seems). This outsider, born out of years of conservative angst, promised to make things better for those who were angry. He said the things he wanted his supporters to hear, and he made vague plans on making America great, while similarly insulting those who dared to make fun of him in 140 characters or less.

And no matter what he said this election – about assaulting women, about Russia, about using nuclear bombs, about gold star mothers – the one thing he banked on was that he convinced everyone that he was comparatively **more trustworthy** than Secretary Clinton. He banked on being a renegade that would bring back the spoils for those who supported him.

And the sad thing is that this worked better than all of the money and power the Clintons had going into election night.

It's hard to see where we go from here.

As I'm writing this here in Edinburgh, there are protests back in the states. My friends are passing around a "California Referendum" petition that would allow the Golden State to secede from the Union. People are talking about moving to Canada or Australia.

But none of this is the solution to how we as a country move forward.

I wholeheartedly believe in our democracy. We would not have lasted this long if it didn't work. And I'll continue to have faith in it because it's my duty to believe that what our founding fathers came up with was for our benefit. I am deeply disappointed by this historic upset, but even in dark moments like these, Americans will continue to move forward, as we always have, despite what has happened this election cycle.

There are a lot of angry and hurt people right now. Democrats and Republicans have historically negative perspectives on one another. 50 percent of this country did not want Trump to be president, and 50 percent of this country did not want Clinton to be president. Even though we are one nation, it has never before felt more like two pieces that don't quite fit together.

However, despite all of this, we must learn how understand why we are all so angry at each other, in hopes of reaching some shaky mutual understanding after many years of fighting. We have to stop ignoring other perspectives and marginalizing conservatives when they really just want to let their voices be heard. The solution is to **not run away**, but to keep moving forward like we always have and remember this moment, and hope we can work together in preventing it from happening again in the future.

I know this is a very idealistic and corny solution (even you can even call it a solution). But this election and all of the shit that happened is democracy at its core. This is how things work sometimes. We don't win all of the time, and sometimes we elect someone who is a complete fucking dildo. 

In all fairness, he hasn't done anything in office yet yet. But no matter what he does and what situations he puts us in, we will move forward and do our best to make it better with the cards we are given, because that's what Americans do.

Mr. Trump, there have been many times in your campaign when you have claimed that your words have just been words. While that may be true, your actions the next four years are what all of us, supporters or not, will be keeping a close eye on. We'll see if you've been talking the talk this whole time, or if your actions will speak louder than the ignorance you advertise.

Let's see if you can actually "Make America Great Again", or if we fall apart.

God bless America.

(And for what it counts, **Hillary Clinton still broke so many ceilings that it's insane**. I have a tremendous amount of respect for her iron will, especially after surviving the most poisonous election cycle in the history of our country. I hope she will find peace in the results, and continue to be an inspiration to girls, women, boys, and men – *people* – everywhere.)
