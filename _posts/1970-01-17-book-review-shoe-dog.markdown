My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1894048684">5 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
Wow. Where to begin. <br /><br />When I was in middle school, I had a track coach who told me the legend of Steve Prefontaine, a runner who literally did not believe in the limits of humanity. My coach always told me one of Pre's famous quotes, "To give anything less than your best is to sacrifice the gift," and I've never heard of a better personification of this quote than the shoe dog that is Phil Knight. (It also can't be a coincidence that Pre and Knight knew each other and have done business with each other, as mentioned in the biography.)<br /><br />What I like about Knight's biography is that there isn't any bullshit. There aren't any frills about how he was inspired, got together a band of super smart people, and went out to create one of the most innovative companies in the history of the world; he leaves in the shitty things that happened too. Each obstacle he describes in a new chapter of his life made me uncomfortable not only because of the nature of the obstacle itself (like when a certain Japanese shoe company tries to sue him for breaching a contract, or when the FBI comes knocking on his door), but because of how terribly honest he is about who he is as a person, and how he still chooses to tackle these problems head on despite the insecurities he knows he might never be able to overcome. <br /><br />Even though Knight is terribly honest about himself, the nice thing is that his brutal honesty makes his finest moments even finer in retrospect. There is a particular moment in the book that really spoke to me: in it, the Onitsuka shoe company has officially pulled its business from Nike (then known as Blue Ribbon), and even though everyone in the company knew that this was very bad financially, Knight spun it around and said that instead of being bad news, Nike had competitors "right where they wanted them." This ability to never give up, to be able to spin bad news into good news... Well, that's a talent I have yet to see in some of the best leaders I know personally.<br /><br />If there's one thing I will get out of this book, it's that any business needs to fight to survive and to always keep moving. Like what Prefontaine said all those years ago, "If someone is going to beat me, they're gonna have to bleed to do it." Knight, despite his introversion and his shy nature, bled because he played, and he played because he was passionate. And there's a lot everyone can learn from that kind of mentality, even if one isn't aiming to be an entrepreneur.
