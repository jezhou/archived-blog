I visited Dublin this weekend and I have to say it's probably one of my favorite places in the world. The last time I visited Dublin, I was around 10 to 11 years old, so having the opportunity to come as an adult was insane.

There were three main things that we did, besides all of the touristy stuff like walking tours and junk. We went to the **Cliffs of Moher**, **Phoenix Park**, and of course, the **Guinness Storehouse**.

## Cliffs of Moher

The journey to the cliffs was about a six hour round trip ride. We stopped by in a fishing village called Kinvara, where I took my best cat picture ever.

I'd like to think this cat was called Fergus. Seriously, it was a pretty mean cat! I didn't scratch or anything, but it really wasn't something I'd like to piss off based on how close it got to my camera. 

We also stopped for lunch at this place where I got the heartiest meal I've eaten since I've gotten to Europe. In Ireland, it's literally meat and potatoes 24/7, and I thought I would enjoy it, but I could literally feel myself getting fatter by the mouthful.

Remind me to exercise when I get back üòÖ

We got to stop by this place called the "baby cliffs" before we got to the big daddy cliffs. I took a pretty good GoPro video here, and also this magnificent picture I will probably not post anywhere else.

Finally, after a long bus ride (I actually wrote my history essay on the way there, talk about having nothing to do) we arrived at the ***CLIFFS OF MOHER*** (dun dun dun).

Jesus Christ are these cliffs insane. Also, there is the shittest barrier ever (Grand Canyon status) so it's literally a one way trip if you happen to fall off. Which is something that almost happened.

Just kidding. It wasn't actually that close. I was trying to take this picture:

And I can tell you, even though it felt like I was in control the entire time, there were points when I was just like, "Oh fuck, if I fall, I wonder what my last thoughts are gonna be." I'm kind of getting nervous just thinking about it.

Some things you don't really know how scary it was until you spend some time thinking about it.

## Phoenix Park

The next day, back in Dublin, we went to go check out this place called Phoenix Park. I don't think this usually pops up on people's radars when they think of visiting Dublin, but I'm so thankful that we visited this place because DAMN I have never been so close to so many stags in my life.

I won't lie, they're kind of cliquey though. Some of them will be sitting down and chillin', but the moment I approach they take a look at me like this

And proceed to turn around. I swear to God I went to high school with these stags (sometimes, it's hard to tell the experiences apart).

I did manage to get a few good shots in though. It's too bad I didn't get to bring my stronger lenses. I would've gotten some really good facial expressions of these friggin' haters.

## Guinness

After we went to the park, we had a quick lunch (very healthy and delicious, unlike anything else this weekend. Also met a cool Irish/American waiter at the cafe) and went straight to the storehouse.

My god. This place was on fire.

My favorite beer as of now is Guinness. It's probably because of my dad, because when I was younger, he was *always* talking about it. I decided the moment I started taking alcohol seriously ‚Äì ahem, not telling you when ‚Äì that I was gonna have a bottle of Guinness.

I remember that bottle. It was imported and not fresh. The Guinness here in Dublin, however, was so thick and rich that it was like drinking black liquid gold. *So good.*

The storehouse tour was pretty cool. We got to inhale some vapors, like a true 21st century thug.

We also got to pour beers like a pro! I like pouring Guinnesses because they're relatively easier to pour than some other beers I've seen people try pouring. Also, there's just something about the amount of time it takes to wait for it to foam up: 119.5 seconds. It really makes you appreciate the brew and not just hand it off to the thirstiest customer.

I was pretty happy when my Guinness poured correctly.

Here's a picture of me sippin' at the Gravity bar. If I could choose a moment in time to freeze forever, this might be it üòÑ üç∫

## Overall

Overall, this trip was pretty dope. I got to see a lot of Dublin, I did touristy things, and I got to drink at bars and stuff. I had a goal of drinking at least 10 Guinnesses in 2 days, but that proved to be a little too much given what I wanted to accomplish this weekend with my friends.

I think the thing I love most about Dublin is the people. They're so damn funny and nice! We had so many Irish people go out of their way to help us this weekend (like they went beyond the call of duty!) and they cracked a lot of funny puns along the way.

I remember asking this dude at a pub if he knew where the bathroom was. He started laughing and asked me, "You're asking me if I know where it is?"

I was a little tipsy at that point but it was all good fun.

Overall, did I have a lot of craic aka fun whil I was here. 100 percent yes, and I would definitely come back. I actually have a layover here on the way back to the United States, so hopefully I can explore a bit more of the city before I head on back to the states.

Thanks Dublin! Keep on keepin' on. Here's one last picture of me reenacting Indiana Jones üòÇ

P.S. If you're planning a trip here, Temple Bar is an *area*, not a bar! The sneaky owners of the bar Temple Bar named in Temple Bar in the Temple Bar area to trick tourists into coming in! (tl;dr check out the bar but it's the whole area, not just that bar üòé)
