title: On a friend's passing
---
The notice came unexpectedly, in an email from dad.

It felt like all of the blood rushed out of my body. I couldn't think. I couldn't feel anything. I was numb.

I close my computer. I walk upstairs to my room. I cry, and I don't stop. He's gone.

****

I skip class the next two days. I just couldn't go. Everything just seemed pointless.

His death was just so sudden and meaningless. There was no time to rationalize or prepare for his passing, like you would for a grandparent in very old age or someone with a terminal sickness. I sit and contemplate, aware that I'm skipping a quiz for a class I need to graduate. 

Do quizzes really even matter in the grand scheme of things?

Class finishes without me. One of my friends walks out of the lecture hall and asks me, "Hey, is everything okay? I haven't seen you in class recently."

The worst part about it is that even though I want other people's comfort in getting through this, I feel guilty because I think there is no reason why people should take pity on me. I was still here.

But I couldn't keep it in anymore. 

"One of my friends from back home unexpectedly passed away. I'm not really sure how to deal with it."

"Oh man. Do you wanna sit down?"

We sit in silence. It was quiet, but it was real. There wasn't any of that fake shit people do when they say they understand but they don't.

He drops a bomb. He tells me one of his friends passed away recently too. He says it isn't over it. I can see that he's about to cry too. "It's okay, man."

He gives me a hug. It was something I wasn't aware I needed until it happened.

"It's just like... I never got to say goodbye. How grateful I am for everything he's done for me. How grateful I am for everything he's taught me."

"I know man. Just take it one day at a time."

****

It's been four days since I found out. I'm a complete mess. One of my best friends comes up to me after an org meeting and asks if I'm handling everything okay. He already knows.

I have too much on my mind, so I say everything that's on it. I don't give a fuck right now. There are people passing by, who glance at me but keep walking.

"I don't know. I'm starting to realize how little I've done to positively influence people in my life. Like what have I even done? Focused on grades, get into college, try and get a good job, and for fucking what? So I can just be rich and have money? What does that even mean?"

He's silent. He puts his hand on my shoulder. I keep rambling, and my sadness turns into a reflective frustration.

"My friend always went out of his way to make people happy, to make sure he was positively affecting everyone and everything he did, and I've realized in the past few days that I only go out of my way to make myself happy. And in retrospect, I'm not! I'm just so sad that I've only focused on myself for the past few years, when I really could've been making the world better around me, like he was doing. It's complete selfishness. It's all just wasted time."

I take a deep breath. I say one last thing.

"I just wish I told him how much of a better person he made me."

My friend finally speaks up. Gives me an unexpected hug.

"You're one of my best friends, and one of the coolest guys I know. If it means anything, you've positively affected my life. And just to let you know, he sounded like a great guy. I would've loved to meet him."

I don't know why, but those words were deeply comforting.

"You would've, man. You really would've."

****

My brother, who was a better friend of his than I was, didn't want to look.

"Man, I can't do this. I'm not ready for this."

He paces for a bit. The service is about to start. I'm not surprised for how many people are in the room.

There are speeches from extended family, close and best friends, and former mentors. Not a single one of them left the podium without tearing up or crying.

I'm just realizing how many people my friend has impacted. It's utterly amazing, even when I think about it today.

His parents come up. They are holding each other tightly. They share a few words, and a heavy sorrow fills the entire room. I realize that what I feel would never be even close to what they feel.

The next few months, I drown myself in work. I don't give myself a moment of idleness or rest because it will cause be to reflect again. As the days go by, it starts to hurt less and less. 

By now, I've made a couple of new friends and I've learned how to laugh again. Things finally get a little easier.

But sometimes, I will randomly see something that reminds me of my friend. Other times, I will be lost in a daydream and think about everything he's taught me. When such moments occur, I will reminisce and feel saddened by our brief time together.

My friend's passing made me very philosophical on my own mortality and the meaning of life. The first few weeks after he passed away, I thought about how easy it was to forget how grateful I am to live, and experience the phenomenon of life. I was mad at the world for being filled with so much meaningless death, and I was mad at myself for focusing on the wrong things for too many years.

It also made me realize how little death affects most people that I know. Lots of people who have never experienced the death of a close friend will try to empathize because they feel like it's the right thing to do. Others will try to help you rationalize it all, with advice like, "He wouldn't want you to be this sad," or "At least he's in a better place now. There's no need to be unhappy, right?"

I feel like this is a deep and fundamental misunderstanding of death. The only thing that can heal such deep wounds is time, and if anything, words sometimes do very little. Just being there for someone, sometimes without saying anything and just giving a hug, is all you really need sometimes.

My point of view on life and my successes have drastically changed since his passing. Before, a lot of my concerns were petty, and my views on happiness were superficial. But if I've learned anything from my dear, departed friend, it's that it's impossible to drift through life and be content with what you are doing if you are not trying to help other people for the better. I don't know if karma exists, but I do know that if I can even try to positively influence other people a fraction of what my friend did, I will be satisfied with what I'm doing with life.

Every day I am trying to apply this with everything I do: making other people laugh, spending time with loved ones, finding passion in purposeful work, and even more. I can't know for sure if what I'm doing will maximize the money I make or ensure my legacy (whatever that means), but I do know that living my life by his example is much more satisfying than whatever I was doing before. 

Life is about laughter. Life is about love. Life is about adventure.

Life is about appreciating the ones who make you who you are. 

And of course, life is about giving back. About making the world a little better than you found it.

You did one hell of a job, Max. Thank you so much.
