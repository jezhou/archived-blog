title: Advice to a younger Jesse
---
A good friend asked me around a year ago about what advice I would give myself if I could go back in time and meet the 18-year-old me. I gave him a response that I thought was suitable at the time, but I've thought about it for months since then, and I think I've finalized list of really important things I've learned since I've been in college.

I've decided to post this list just in case this advice is helpful for those people who are still trying to find their way. That, and in case a wormhole opens one day, I will toss a printout of this post into the abyss in hopes I can teach myself things that you can only learn with time.

So that being said, here are the things I would tell a younger me if I ever had the opportunity to.

#### Don't ever give up. Ever.

#### Don't compare yourself with other people

My freshman year of college was kind of miserable. It was definitely not the Hollywood definition of college, which basically promised me 4 years of getting drunk, meeting new girls, and having a lot of school spirit. Don't get me wrong, these opportunities were definitely available for me, but I chose not to indulge mainly because I was more focused on my future career. Getting ahead consumed me.

Of course, I need to explain the context. As many people know, computer science is a highly competitive major that requires a lot of skill, experience, and a roll of the dice to get the good opportunities everyone seems to be talking about. I'm talking jobs and internships at Google, Facebook, or Microsoft: the trifecta of opportunities that seem to define what a "good" computer science student should be able to achieve.

My first year, I was obsessed with getting good grades and going to hackathons to basically polish my resume as much as I could ahead of the job fair. I wanted to be part of the trifecta. I wanted to be considered a great programmer. Of course, a lot of this required staying in my room and working a lot in my free time.

You can imagine what this did to my social life. I stopped going out for awhile. I thought all of the student organizations that remotely interested me were now a waste of time.

Meanwhile, I was looking at my high school friends' updates on social media, and it was just a massive array of college accomplishments that I seemed to be missing. Everyone seemed to be doing something great, and a few people did manage to get jobs at the places I wanted to work at. Of course, the inevitable thoughts emerge.

> What did he do to get this opportunity? How is she accomplishing so much when I feel like I've been working my ass off? Why am I not like any of these people?

And the worst thought of them all...

> What am I doing wrong?

I started beating myself up a lot, for everything. For not knowing answers, for being rejected for countless internship opportunities. Even for really stupid things, like not starting to learn computer science when I was in like 5th grade or something. Every time I saw a friend get another opportunity, a knot would form in my stomach. I wanted to keep trying harder and harder, so I could be like them.

I never got any of the opportunities I wanted my first year. In hindsight, I definitely don't think it was from a lack of trying, but that's besides the point. I was poisoning myself with these comparisons to other people. Every time I opened Facebook, every time I saw a person who I yearned to be, I pushed my spirit down a little more. And now, I know that was wrong.

The key to being a happier person, I've found, is to be okay with yourself and to forgive yourself for the things you haven't done and will never do. Yes, some people in high school are curing cancer at the age of 16 and making startups before they even graduate, and some people will be accepted to Yale and be given a guaranteed position at Google. But the real thing I should ask myself when I see such people is this:

> So fucking what? Good for them, I'm happy they're changing the world. I can learn a lot from them, but I should not be jealous of them. 

>I am not a lesser person because these people are doing great things. I will do great things on my own, things that will be defined by my hard work and passion alone.

#### Don't let people hold you back. Try something new!

#### Don't suffocate your creativity

#### Don't invest too much into the culture

#### You will never be ready when someone close to you dies

#### You save more money if you cook your own food.

#### Exercise when you can! It sucks being fat.

#### Love is complicated, no matter who you are.

Eventually, the fights and the distance will chip at you over time. Then, the growing apart fills the cracks, and eventually separates what you thought was concrete and for sure. 

It hurts a lot. And that's okay. It's part of growing up. It's part of discovering what you really want in love. It's part of being able to handle loss, and realizing when people are better off apart than together.

And someday you will realize that your own identity needs to be forged before you even consider sharing it with someone for the rest of your life.

I used to think in high school that people who broke up just didn't try hard enough to a romance. Now I know better. You don't stop loving each other, ever. You just realize that you will both grow more separately, and really, that's what being an adult is about. 

#### Focus on being happy, whatever that means for you.
