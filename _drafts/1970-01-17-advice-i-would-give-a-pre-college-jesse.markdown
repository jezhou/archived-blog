title: Advice I would give a pre-college Jesse
---
For the last couple of months, I've been thinking about my time as an undergraduate and what I could've done differently, perhaps better, throughout my time at UC San Diego. It turns out that I'm largely happy at the end of it all, and there are quite a few experiences I wouldn't change about college even if I had the opportunity to go back and make a few edits. 

However, that doesn't mean that I think there aren't any lessons that I had to learn the hard way. These are the things that I wouldn't change even though it sucked to experience them, purely for the lessons they taught me. From breakups to classes to meeting people, there are a lot of things I think I could've done a little better if I had more experience. So I've sat down and contemplated a few things I would go back and tell a younger version of myself if I could, and compiled it all into a list for the people who are still young, and still have a vast and unknown college career ahead of them.
